# K-means algorithm
Description: Implementation of the K-means algorithm in 2020 for the elective course "Coputational Intelligence" for my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and 
Engineering at University of Ioannina. The main goal of this assignment was to implement the K-means algorithm for any data written in a .txt file. An example file is
inconcluded as well, named "Test.txt". The output files that are generated within the script, can be used to other software, to create scatter plots, for a better 
visualization of the results of the algorithm.
